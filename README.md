# LLM-Prediction-Sentiment-Analysis
Through some Ollama models and pure Python the code retrieves a variety of outputs from a diverse range of LLMs and outputs a score either for or against the ticker.

I originally made this project a year ago but in my inexperience I made it rather disorganized and there was some leaked info. Hence I created this new repo with some modifications based on where I am at now.
